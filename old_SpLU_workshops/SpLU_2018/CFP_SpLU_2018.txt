FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS
----------------------------------------------------------------

First International Workshop on Spatial Language Understanding at NAACL-HLT 2018, June 5/6, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. 

Website: https://spatial-language.github.io/

---------------------------------------------------------------
AIM AND SCOPE 
---------------------------------------------------------------

One of the essential functions of natural language is to express spatial relationships between objects. Linguistic constructs can encode highly complex, relational structures of objects, spatial relations between them, and patterns of motion through space relative to some reference point. Spatial language understanding is useful in many areas of research endeavors relating to and/or making use of human language, including robotics, navigation, geographic information systems, traffic management, natural language understanding and translation, and query answering systems. 

Standardizing semantically specialized linguistic tasks related to spatial language especially seems challenging as it is hard to obtain an agreeable set of concepts, relationships and a formal spatial meaning representation that is domain independent. This has made research results on spatial language learning and reasoning diverse, task-specific and, to some extent, not comparable. While formal meaning representation is a general issue for language understanding, formalizing spatial concepts and building formal reasoning models based on those constitute challenging research problems with a wealth of prior foundational research that can be exploited and linked to language understanding. Existing qualitative and quantitative representation and reasoning models can be used for investigation of interoperabiltiy of machine learning and reasoning over spatial semantics. Research endeavors in this area could provide insights into many challenges of language understanding in general. Spatial semantics is also very well-connected and relevant to visualization of natural language, central to dealing with configurations in the physical world and motivating a combination of vision and language for richer spatial understanding. 

This workshop highlights some of the above aspects of computational spatial language understanding including the following four areas: Spatial Language Meaning Representation (Continuous, Symbolic), Spatial Language Learning, Spatial Language Reasoning, and Combining Vision and Language for Spatial Understanding. The goal of the workshop is to initiate discussions across fields dealing with spatial language along with other modalities. The desired outcome is identification of shared as well as unique challenges, problems and future directions across the fields and various application domains related to spatial language understanding.
